You are working inside the existing OceanGuard Replit project (React + TypeScript + Tailwind + Three.js, Node/Express backend, Postgres w/ Drizzle, MongoDB mirror, SSE for real-time). 

GOAL:
Remove/retire the “Sustainability Education Hub” feature and replace it with a new feature called:

✅ “OceanGuard School Scoreboard”
A classroom-friendly sustainability competition that lets schools “adopt” one of the 20 monitored cities, earn points through actions, and appear on a live leaderboard.

NON-NEGOTIABLE REQUIREMENTS:
1) Completely remove Education Hub pages/routes/nav items/components and any references in copy.
2) Add Scoreboard feature end-to-end (frontend + backend + database schema + seed + API).
3) Keep design consistent with the rest of the app (Tailwind + Framer Motion, cards, clean layout).
4) Must feel like “Best Hack for Sustainability in Education”: schools + classroom action + sustainability outcomes.

FEATURE SPEC:
A) Core UX
- New nav item: “Scoreboard”
- Main page shows:
  - Global leaderboard of schools (ranked by total points)
  - “Adopted city” for each school
  - Weekly points + all-time points toggle
  - Badges for milestones (e.g., “First Cleanup”, “$100 Funded”, “100kg Removed”)
  - Quick filters: City, Region, K-12 vs College

B) School Profile Page
- Clicking a school opens a profile:
  - School name, type (K-12 / College), location (optional), adopted city
  - Points breakdown by category with a simple chart (no custom colors)
  - Timeline of actions (recent activities)
  - Impact summary: trash removed estimate, volunteers, funds raised, CO2 equivalent (simple conversion is OK)
  - “Join/Submit Action” button (creates a pending action)

C) Actions that earn points
Create a simple, auditable action logging system:
Action types (minimum):
1) “Classroom Mission Completed” (teacher-run activity)
2) “Cleanup Event Logged”
3) “Donation Raised” (ties to your existing cleanup operations + Solana donation receipts if available)
4) “Awareness Activity” (e.g., presentation, poster campaign)

Each action has:
- id, school_id, action_type, city_id, timestamp
- points_awarded
- evidence fields: description + optional URL + optional Solana tx signature
- status: PENDING / APPROVED / REJECTED

D) Scoring rules (implement as code constants)
- Classroom Mission Completed: +50 points
- Cleanup Event Logged: +200 points + (2 points per kg trash removed)
- Donation Raised: +1 point per $1 (cap 500 per donation)
- Awareness Activity: +75 points
Add milestone badges:
- First Action
- 500 points
- 1,000 points
- $100 raised
- 100kg removed

E) Admin review (simple)
- Add a lightweight admin screen (can be hidden behind an ENV var or a hardcoded dev check) to approve/reject pending actions.
- When approved, points are added to school totals and leaderboard updates live.

F) Real-time updates
- Use your existing SSE patterns to push leaderboard updates (every 30–60s OR on action approval).

DATABASE (Postgres + Drizzle):
Add tables (names flexible):
- schools
  - id (uuid)
  - name
  - type (ENUM: K12, COLLEGE)
  - adopted_city_id (references cities table you already have)
  - created_at
- school_actions
  - id (uuid)
  - school_id (fk)
  - action_type (ENUM)
  - city_id (fk)
  - description
  - evidence_url (nullable)
  - solana_tx_sig (nullable)
  - kg_trash_removed (nullable numeric)
  - donation_usd (nullable numeric)
  - status (ENUM: PENDING, APPROVED, REJECTED)
  - points_awarded (numeric)
  - created_at
  - reviewed_at (nullable)
- school_point_totals (optional materialized table; OK to compute on fly if performant)
  - school_id
  - total_points
  - weekly_points (points in last 7 days)

If you already have a cities table, reuse it. If not, create a simple cities table with the 20 cities already tracked in the globe view.

API (Node/Express):
Implement REST endpoints:
- GET /api/scoreboard/leaderboard?period=weekly|alltime&city_id=&type=
- GET /api/scoreboard/schools/:id
- POST /api/scoreboard/schools (create school) [optional for demo]
- POST /api/scoreboard/actions (submit pending action)
