SF Hacks – Student Onboarding Guide: IBM webMethods Hybrid Integration (IWHI) + API Connect
Welcome to SF Hacks! This guide gets you from the welcome email to a running no‑code workflow published as an API. 
Step 1 — Open Your IWHI Environment from the Welcome Email
Check your inbox for an email titled 'Welcome to IBM webMethods Hybrid Integration'. Click the link in that email to open the IBM SaaS Console and your assigned service instance. Access to IWHI begins from this email link.
IBM Docs – Getting Started: https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/hybrid-integration/saas?topic=getting-started
Step 2 — Launch Integration (webMethods.io Integration)
In the IBM SaaS Console, open your IWHI service instance. Click the Integration capability to launch the webMethods.io Integration designer (no‑code workflow builder).
Product Overview (Integration, connectors, no‑code): https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/wm-integration-ipaas?topic=overview
Step 3 — Create Your Project
In Integration, go to Projects → + New Project. Name it for your team (e.g., SFH2026_Team_7). This is your workspace for workflows and assets.
Beginner flow and UI orientation (community guide): https://community.ibm.com/community/user/viewdocument/getting-started-with-webmethodsio?CommunityKey=82b75916-ed06-4a13-8eb6-0190da9f1bfa
Step 4 — Build a No‑Code Workflow
Inside your project: Workflows → Add Workflow → choose an HTTP Trigger. Add steps using the visual editor and return a simple JSON response for testing.
Hands-on tutorials (videos + steps): https://community.ibm.com/community/user/blogs/webmethods-community-member/2024/02/23/webmethodsio-integration-super-ipaas-step-by-step-tutorials
Step 5 — Add a Connector (Optional but Recommended)
Add a connector block (e.g., Slack, Twilio, Email/SMTP, HTTP, MySQL/Postgres). Keep it simple for speed; avoid OAuth‑heavy connectors.
Examples repo (Slack, MySQL, etc.): https://github.com/ibm-wm-transition/webMethods-io-examples
Step 6 — Test the Workflow
Use the built‑in Test panel to send a request to your HTTP trigger and verify the JSON response and any connector side effects (e.g., Slack message).
Step 7 — Export Your API (OpenAPI)
Open your workflow’s API tab and export the OpenAPI definition (openapi.yaml). This file describes your API so it can be imported into API Connect.
Pattern reference (workflow → OpenAPI → API Connect): https://community.ibm.com/community/user/blogs/bino-varghese/2025/09/02/exposing-webmethods-integration-as-apis
Step 8 — Import and Publish in API Connect (Keep it Simple)
Open API Connect → Drafts → APIs → Add → Import. Upload openapi.yaml. Apply one simple policy: API Key. Publish to get a gateway URL. Copy that URL for your client app or Postman.
API Gateway basics (policies, security): https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/wams/wm-api-gateway-saas/11.1.0?topic=overview
Step 9 — Call Your API
Use Postman or your client (Node/React/Python/mobile) to call the published gateway URL. If an API key is required, add it to your request headers as instructed by your admin.
Tips and Pitfalls to Avoid
- Start simple: one HTTP trigger + one connector + JSON response.
- Avoid OAuth‑heavy connectors during the hackathon; use Slack, Twilio, Email/SMTP, HTTP, or simple DB inserts.
- Keep API Connect configuration minimal (API Key only).
- If you can’t log in, you likely were not added yet—ask an admin to add your email so you receive the welcome email.
